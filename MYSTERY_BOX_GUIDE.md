A brief guide to the Mystery Box system. Spin for random challenges, complete them with friends, and earn bonus XP.

## Tokens

| | |
|---|---|
| **Earn** | 1 token every 24 hours |
| **Cap** | 3 tokens |
| **Use** | 1 token per spin (everyone in the lobby spends 1 each) |

---

## Lobby (Host + 3 Members)

### Create a lobby
- Click **Create Lobby**. You become the host.

### Invite friends
1. Host clicks **Invite** on an empty slot.
2. Search friends → click **Invite**.
3. Friends receive a notification and can join.

### Kick a member
- Host hovers over a member’s slot → click the **kick icon** (✕) in the corner.

### Leave
- Any member or host can click **Leave Group**. Host leaving removes the lobby.

---

## Spin (Host Only)

1. Host opens **Change Rules** (optional) to set filters:
   - Exclude games
   - Exclude speedruns
   - Max round (e.g. no challenges over round 50)
2. Host clicks **Spin the Box**.
3. Everyone in the lobby spends 1 token.
4. A random game, map, and challenge are rolled.

**Note:** Invites are locked after a spin. Invite everyone before spinning.

## After a Spin

### Roll result
- Game, map, challenge name
- Stipulations (e.g. No Jug, Fate Only)
- Bonus XP range (e.g. 5–100)

### Log the challenge
- Click **Log This Challenge** → fills the map’s log form and adds Mystery Box bonus XP.

### Discard (host only)
- Host clicks **Discard**.
- A warning appears. Confirm to **start a vote**.
- All lobby members see a vote modal:
  - **Yes, discard** — agree to toss the challenge
  - **No, keep it** — veto
- Challenge is only discarded if everyone votes **Yes**. One **No** cancels it.
- Once discarded, invites reopen and you can spin again.

### Reroll (host only)
- Uses another token and discards the current challenge.
- Opens **Change Rules** first to adjust filters, then **Reroll**.
- Same token rules apply (everyone must have tokens).

## XP

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Filters** | More restrictive = lower base XP (e.g. 50% if you exclude speedruns + games) |
| **Round** | Higher round completed = more bonus XP |
| **Co-op** | Teammates who log the same challenge get the same bonus XP (unverified) |
